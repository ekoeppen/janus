\ # Janus
\
\ Janus is a Forth meta compiler. As a meta compiler, it is written in Forth to
\ produce another Forth compiler. Janus has been tested with GForth as the host
\ compiler and can so far compile CoreForth-0 and eForth.
\
\ Good background reading about meta compilers is
\ [Meta eForth DTC](http://www.ultratechnology.com/meta1.html)
\ and
\ [Embed Forth](https://github.com/howerj/embed/blob/master/embed.fth),
\ Janus takes inspiration from both projects.
\
\ ## Wordlists
\
\ Janus performs meta compilation by using Forth wordlists to generate a target
\ image. The three wordlists are `host`, `meta` and `target`.
\
\ ### `host` wordlist
\
\ The `host` wordlist is the outer wordlist, active when Janus starts, containing
\ words which are used to interact with the host system, such as file I/O. It also
\ contains all words which handle the target image, e.g. adding words to the target
\ image, or compiling data into the target image.
\
\ ### `meta` wordlist
\
\ The `meta` wordlist is active during processing of the target Forth. It
\ contains immediate words which handle for example compilation of control flow.
\ In a non-meta Forth, these words would be defined in terms of the target Forth,
\ but in a meta compiled Forth setup, these words are based on the host Forth to
\ build the target image.
\
\ ### `target` wordlist
\
\ The `target` wordlist contains the dictionary of the target words as they are
\ created while processing the target Forth. These words will when called compile
\ a call to themselves into the target code space.
\
\ ## Implementation
\
\ Set up the `target` and `meta` wordlists. The `host` wordlist is not explicitly
\ created, the `Forth` wordlist is used as a simplification.

wordlist constant target-wordlist
wordlist constant meta-wordlist

\ Create helper words to switch between the word lists. `::host::` will reset the
\ current wordlist to `Forth` for definitions and compilation. `::meta::` will do
\ additionally add the `meta` wordlist as the first wordlist to be searched and
\ use for definitions.
\
\ `::target::` works a bit differently: When it is selected, words will be by default
\ defined in the `host` (`Forth`) wordlist. This is however just the default, during
\ meta compilation, target words will be added to the target wordlist (see `tcreate`
\ below). Words will be searched first in the `meta` wordlist to handle control
\ structures, and then in the `target` wordlist to lookup and compile target words
\ into the target image.

: ::host::    only forth definitions ;
: ::meta::    only forth meta-wordlist >order definitions ;
: ::target::  only forth definitions target-wordlist >order meta-wordlist >order ;

\ ## Set up the host definitions
\
\ Switch to the host worklist:

::host::

\ Numbers in hex by default:

hex

\ Load support for writing Intel Hex files, usually used by the target Forth
\ to write out the final image.

include intel-hex.ft

\ Some basic string and path utility words:

include utils.ft

\ Define the different threading types. Note that the support here only
\ goes as far as allowing to set the type via the command line, but the
\ actual implementation is outside of Janus within the target Forth.

0 constant STC
1 constant DTC
2 constant ITC

\ Define variables holding the command line arguments:

  create source-file $400 allot
variable tethered
  create tether-port $400 allot
  create tether-speed $10 allot
variable threading-type

       STC threading-type !
         0 tether-port c!
         0 source-file c!

\ Load the words used for command line argument parsing:

include args.ft

\ Parse the command line arguments and update the variables above:

parse-args

\ If the source path is a relative path, prepend the current working
\ directory to the source file to create an absolute path and allow Janus
\ to include the file:

#512 string path
source-file count path abs-path>string

\ Define the ROM and RAM base addresses. In a pure RAM based system,
\ these would have the same value. These will be set by the target
\ Forth.

        0 value trom
        0 value tram

\ Define the target Forth cell size, this is also set by the target Forth.

        0 value tcell

\ Define a value for the exception thrown if at the end of the compilation,
\ the stack is not balanced:

        2 constant non-empty-stack

\ The target image size is 64k by default:

$00010000 constant target#

\ ### Meta compilation helpers
\
\ During meta compilation, the target image is compiled similar to a non-meta
\ compiled Forth. Many of the definitions below are implemented in similar terms
\ as in a regular Forth, but in order to avoid name conflicts, almost all are
\ prefixed with `t`.
\
\ The target dictionary pointer, i.e. the address into the target image to
\ which values are written during meta compilation:

variable tdp

\ The target variable pointer. In systems with a combined code and variable
\ space, this variable is not used.

variable tvp

\ Declare and set the `last` pointer for the target to the beginning of the
\ target image.

variable tlast 0 tlast !

\ Allocate the target image and fill it with 0xFF:

create #target target# allot
       #target target# -1 fill

\ Convert a target relative address to an index into the target binary:

: >target   #target + trom - ;

\ ### Target dictionary pointer
\
\ Operations on the target dictionary pointer, similar to their non-meta
\ counterparts.

: there     tdp @ ;
: torg      tdp ! ;
: taligned  tcell 1- + tcell negate and ;
: talign    there taligned tdp ! ;
: tallot    tdp +! ;

\ ### Writing data to the target image
\
\ All operations use target relative addresses, which are converted to
\ indices to the target image.

: t!        >target tcell 4 = if l! else w! then ;
: tc@       >target c@ ;
: t@        >target l@ ;
: tc!       >target c! ;
: th!       >target w! ;
: t,        there t! tcell tallot ;
: tc,       there tc! 1 tallot ;
: th,       there th! 2 tallot ;
: talloc    trom tram <> if tvp @ t, tvp +!
            else there tcell + t, tallot
            then ;

\ ### Finding words
\
\ Looking up words in the target wordlist, to e.g. get the body address:

: (tfind)   target-wordlist search-wordlist ;
: tfind     2dup (tfind) 0= if cr type ."  not found" cr 1 throw then
            nip nip >body @ ;
: t'        parse-name tfind ;

\ Compile the body address as a literal:

: [t']      t' postpone literal ; immediate

\ #### Compiling special actions
\
\ A target Forth can control with the words below how different key parts
\ of a Forth system are compiled into the target image (the `,` in the names
\ below indicates a store into the directory). The words are deferred, so that
\ they can be imlpemented by the target Forth. The actual implementation
\ depends also on the threading model.
\
\ Compile the action for pushing a constant:

defer t,docon

\ Compile the code needed when entering (sometimes called `DOCOL`) and exiting
\ (`EXIT`) a Forth word:

defer t,enter
defer t,exit

\ Compile the action for starting a code word, this is only used for ITC threading:

defer t,docode

\ Compile the actions for entering and exiting an interrupt handler (e.g. saving
\ and restoring CPU state:

defer t,doirq
defer t,irqexit

\ Compile the `NEXT` action into the code:

defer t,next

\ Compile the invocation of another words:

defer t,call

\ Compile the `LIT` action into the code (pushing the next word to the stack):

defer t,lit

\ Compile unconditional and conditional branches:

defer t,branch
defer t,?branch

\ Compile the prelude to a DOES> invocation:

defer t,dodoes

\ The target Forth can implement different header formats, such as normal
\ headers, or headerless words. The words below interact with the target
\ image: `thead` creates a word header in the image, `tlink>` (equivalent to
\ `LINK>`) calculates the code field address, and `timmediate` sets the
\ immediate flag of the current word.

defer thead
defer tlink>
defer timmediate

\ ### Word creation
\
\ Create a word in the target wordlist using standard `CREATE` semantics,
\ at creation time, the current pointer into the target image is stored,
\ and at run time, that address will be compiled as a call into the
\ target image.

: (tcreate) create there , does> @ t,call ;
: tcreate   get-current target-wordlist set-current (tcreate) set-current ;

\ Parse a word, but leave it in the input stream. Keeping the word in the
\ input stream allows the dual word creation (target and target image):

: lookahead >in @ >r parse-name r> >in ! ;

\ Look up a word in the target wordlist, and compile a call to it into
\ the target image:

: tfwdref   tfind t,call ;

\ Creates a word in the target dictionary:

: t:        lookahead thead tcreate ;

\ End a word definition:

: t;        ;

\ ### Utility functions
\
\ Some utility functions follow. First a function to create the name part of
\ a word header:

: pack$     dup >r 2dup c! 1+ 2dup + 0 swap ! swap cmove r> ;

\ Then, hex dump of the target image:

: tdump     #target there dump ;

\ Finally, a word to list the target wordlist definitions:

: tlist     target-wordlist >order
            context @ 8 + begin @ dup while
              dup name>int >body @ 8 u.r space dup id. cr
            repeat drop
            previous ;

\ Check at the end of the meta compilation if the stack is balanced,
\ then list all defined words:

: final     depth if
              ." Stack not empty: " cr
              .s cr
              non-empty-stack throw
            then
            cr tlist
            ;

\ ## Meta compiler definitions
\
\ Switch to the meta wordlist for the following definitions. The definitions
\ make up the core of the meta compiler.

::meta::

\ Include the words needed to parse regular and code word definitions:

include parse.ft
include code.ft

\ To compile `s"`, a couple of helper strings are useful:

create squote$ char s c, char " c,
create (squote)$ char ( c, char s c, char " c, char ) c,

\ Another helper string, used for looking up `type` in the target
\ wordlist:

: type$     s" type" ;

\ The following words are immediate words, which will create control
\ structures in the target image. They resemble their counterparts
\ of a regular Forth system, except that they interact with the target
\ image via the words defined in the host wordlist above.

: immediate immediate timmediate ;

: postpone  parse-name target-wordlist search-wordlist dup 0= throw
            swap >body @ swap
            0< if t,lit t, s" ,call" tfwdref
               else t,call
               then ;
: if        t,?branch there tcell tallot ;
: else      t,branch there tcell tallot there rot t! ;
: then      there swap t! ;
: begin     there ;
: while     t,?branch there tcell tallot swap ;
: again     t,branch t, ;
: until     t,?branch t, ;
: repeat    t,branch t, there swap t! ;
: ahead     t,branch there tcell tallot ;
: does>     t,dodoes ;
: for       s" >r" tfwdref there ;
: next      s" (next)" tfwdref t, ;
: aft       drop t,branch there tcell tallot there swap ;
: recurse   tlast @ tlink> t,call ;
: do        s" (do)" tfwdref there ;
: loop      s" (loop)" tfwdref t,?branch t, ;
: (         [char] ) word drop ;
: \         refill drop ;
: [']       t,lit t' t, ;
: [char]    t,lit char t, ;
: s"        (squote)$ 4 tfwdref
            $22 word dup dup c@ 1+ there #target + trom - swap cmove
            c@ 1+ tallot talign ;
: ."        s" type$ tfwdref ;

: constant  t: t,docon t, ;
: variable  t: t,docon tcell talloc ;
: buffer:   t: t,docon talloc ;

\ ### Create words in the target image
\
\ Below are the words which are actually creating new definitions
\ in the target wordlist and image. The principle is to first generate
\ the target wordlist entry and target image header, compile the needed
\ entry action, and then keep parsing and interpreting words from the
\ input stream.
\
\ During parsing, each word will, when executed, compile a call to itself
\ into the target image, or via the words defined above, compile
\ control structures.
\
\ #### IRQ Handlers
\
\ IRQ handlers might need different entry and exit actions, thus
\ two words are defined below which provide hooks for this.
\ IRQ handlers are creared by first creating a definition in the target
\ wordlist and image, compiling the code needed for entering an IRQ
\ and then parsing and executing the rest of the input stream.
\
\ When `;i` is encountered in the input stream, it will add the code
\ for exiting an IRQ handler, finish the definition in the target
\ wordlist, and set the flag for finishing parsing further words.

: i:        t: t,doirq read-word ;
: ;i        t,irqexit t; end-word ;

\ #### Regular Forth words
\
\ First, define `meta:` as an alias to the current colon definition start
\ word, used to keep defining words in the meta wordlist.

: meta:     : ;

\ Colon is now redefined to define words in the target wordlist and image.
\ After creating the definitions in the wordlist and image, compile the
\ enter action (e.g. `DOCOL` for a DTC Forth), and keep parsing and executing
\ words in the input stream as in the IRQ handler case.

: :         t: t,enter read-word ;

\ Use the previous colon definition to define the word used for finishing
\ a definition in target wordlist and image, and signal the end of the parsing
\ loop.

meta:       ; t,exit t; end-word ;

\ ## Compile the target Forth
\
\ Load the source file (e.g. CoreForth-0 for a specific board) given on the
\ command line.

\ Load words for tethering support:

include tether.ft

::meta::

path string-count included

\ ## End compilation
\
\ End with the `host` wordlist active, output some final statistics and stop.

::host::

final

bye
